#Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
#But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and
#for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are
#multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

#STEPS:
  #need iteration count 1-100
  If / Else loop
  #is there a way to use % for mult of 3?
  #print Fizz
  #is there a way to use % for mult of 5?
  #print Buzz
  #how to eval both numbers?
  #print FizzBuzz
